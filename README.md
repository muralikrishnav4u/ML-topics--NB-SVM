# ML-topics--NB-SVM
basic pet projects(my first ML pet project)
Diving into the insights of the Enron fraud case and identifying patterns:

Data processing was applied and features of persons are obtained in a pickle file.
Outlier detection was made with visualization techniques and linear regression. *Insights of salary, bonuses and stock values are used for clustering the fraudsters.
Classifying the emails between two persons based on the text of the email:

The text of an email is inputted as a list of strings. Independent weights are allocated to most common words used by persons.
The predictive analysis was made using classification algorithms like NB, SVM, Decision trees, kNN etc.
This project is planned to impart a working knowledge of Supervised classification, Regression. In this pet-project I used the most popular Enron dataset. I also got hands on with the text classification with the email classification. I mainly dealt with the scikit-learn, pandas, numpy, matplotlib. You can encounter some interesting topics/libraries in this project some of them are:

Classification

* Naive Bayes
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* kNN (k-nearest neighbors)
* AdaBoost
* Random forests
Regression

* Linear regression
Outliers

* Outlier detection
* Removal of outliers
Clustering

Text Classification

Pickle (to interpret and write a file in the very accessible means)

Testing a model and coming up with the accuracy score of the model
